    "Ans: A database is an organized collection of data, typically stored and accessed electronically. It allows users to store, manage, and retrieve data in a structured format. Databases are used in various applications, from small-scale applications to large-scale enterprise systems. The data in a database is usually organized into tables, rows, and columns, making it easier to manage and query.\n",
